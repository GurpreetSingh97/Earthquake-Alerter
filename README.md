# TheEarthquakeApp

Built an android app to display a list of recent earthquakes all around the world.  
The user has the option to choose the sorting parameter(magnitude/date) and the number of earthquakes to be shown.  
Clicking on any row in the list view will open a website with more detailed information about that particular earthquake.

Download the [TheEarthquakeApp.apk](https://github.com/GurpreetSingh97/TheEarthquakeAndroidApp/tree/master/apkFile) file and run it either on an emulator or an android phone.
